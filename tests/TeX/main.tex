\subsubsection{Three Key Points to Remember About Reconstruction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Wartime: What Lincoln wanted to do
    \item Presidential: What Johnson wanted to do
    \item Congressional: Radical Reconstruction
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Doesn't want return to South, wants entirely new South protecting freedman and removing slavery sympathizers
        \item North wanted the 3.5 million votes of the freedman
        \item Johnson vetoed many attempts
        \item What honor does Johnson share with Bill Clinton? Impeachment
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Black Codes - Trying to Subvert Reconstruction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Southern laws to separate and segregate races
    \item Due to vagrancy laws, freedman were given the option of sharecropping for low wages or going to prison
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Reconstruction Era}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Essay question referring to being most disgraceful period in American History
    \item Missed opportunities since Republicans only wanted political sway in the South
    \item In class assignment on the 1865 literacy test
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Thirteenth Amendment}

\begin{itemize}
    \item First Reconstruction Amendment
    \item Even by 1865 North knew afterwards the U.S. would never have slavery
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Southern Republican Party}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Led by carpetbaggers
    \item No support from the Northern repubs
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{"Waving the Bloody Shirt"}

\begin{itemize}
    \item North cannot decide what to do with Southern politicians
    \item waves the bloody shirt against southern politicians and yells that you started the war so you have to listen to us; ends up creating more of a divide
\end{itemize}
